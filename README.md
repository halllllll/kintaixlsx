# Automate the checking fuckin kintai god excel yourself

Is that excel - a job where the format is fixed and you type in the time for going to work and leaving work every day - really something that **PEOPLE** should do?

# Background (poem)
On me now, heired as a programmer, when my first job changes and career of programmer, this company hasn't any engineering culture,neither technical role model, tests, consensus, nor any team. 

Coming to the office 30 minutes before starting work (Of course, this is not included in working hours.), cleaning up the office, chanting corporate ethics at the morning assembly every morning and pledging to dedicate oneself to the company, reading around small stories about morality and ethics with consciousness of "virtue", "good", "Thank you." and especially "Customer", and telling each other what you think. It was a retrograde company immersed in the typical irrational Japanese corporate culture. Wow! Welcome fxx'xx Japan!!! 

There's a mysterious culture that lets people manage their daily schedules, their accomplishments, and their time to and from work in Excel, which doesn't really hurt me when I'm supposed to be hired as a programmer. The Raspberry pi camera, for example, will automatically determine whether you're going to work in the morning or not.

However, since many Japanese companies disregard technology, such a rational achievement cannot be expected, and they have no sense of doubt about their old constitution. What I can do is to stop the quality of life that is being eroded every day.

By the way, everyone in the office doesn't use github and can't read English at all, so it's written openly like this. Wow! Thx for fxx'xx worst education system of this country!
